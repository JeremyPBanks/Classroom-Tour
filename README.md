# Teaching-Myself-Unreal
The title describes all this repository is: just my trials and tribulations as I attempt to teach myself Unreal Engine 4. I will only be uploading the code of classes I have written (or edited, in which case I will describe as such in a comment at the top of the code). Remember: this is not a substantial project in itself! Any projects that I develop that I decide to flesh out will be given their own repository in the future, but this is not the place for that! So, feel free to look at me struggle to actually grasp all the built-in C++ classes the engine has...or not. Again, it's not as though this is a concrete project. If nothing else, this will primarily serve for my benefit to simply track my progress with the engine, as I plan to use it extensively for years to come.
